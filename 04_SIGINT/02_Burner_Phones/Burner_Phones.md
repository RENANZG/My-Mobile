<h3>BURNER PHONES</h3>

<p><em>The GSM network is highly traceable, even a turned-off cell phone is no longer safe.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid Reusing SIM Cards or Devices:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Always use a new SIM card and a new device
        for each communication session. This prevents the possibility of
        linking different activities together through the same hardware
        or SIM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Avoid Carrying Different Devices Together:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Never carry your burner phone along with your
        primary phone or other devices. If you do, the devices can be correlated
        through proximity tracking or geolocation data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Avoid Creating Physical Associations Between Different Devices:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Use different locations when using different
        devices. Do not use a burner phone in places you frequently visit
        or where your primary phone is usually active. This prevents linking
        the burner to your personal identity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Avoid Calling or Being Called by the Same Contacts on Different Devices:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure that your burner phone is used to
        contact individuals who do not have your primary phone number.
        This helps avoid linking different devices through shared contacts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use Cash or Anonymous Payment Methods:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Purchase burner phones and SIM cards with cash
        or through anonymous payment methods. Avoid using credit cards
        or any payment method that can be traced back to you.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Buy Devices Far from Home:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Purchase your burner phone and SIM card from
        locations far from where you live or frequently visit. Avoid places
        with surveillance cameras that could capture your purchase.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Disable GPS and Location Services:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Turn off all location services, GPS, and Wi-Fi
        on the burner phone to reduce the risk of location tracking. If
        possible, disable or remove the GPS hardware entirely.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Avoid Storing Personal Information:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Do not store any personal information, contacts,
        or messages on the burner phone. Use it strictly for the intended
        temporary purpose and dispose of it afterward.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use Encrypted Communication Apps:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> When communicating through a burner phone,
        use encrypted messaging apps like Signal, Session, SimpleX, or
        Telegram. Be cautious as some apps may still leak metadata.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Be Aware of IMSI Catchers:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid areas known to have heavy surveillance
        or where IMSI catchers (devices that mimic cell towers to intercept
        communications) might be deployed. These can be used to track and
        intercept burner phone communications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Practice Good Operational Security (OpSec):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Develop and maintain strict OpSec habits, such
        as only turning on the burner phone when necessary, and never using
        it at home or work. Dispose of the phone after use in a secure
        manner, such as by dismantling and destroying it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Remove or Disable Microphones and Cameras:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Consider physically removing or disabling the
        phoneâ€™s microphones and cameras to prevent audio and video surveillance.
        Many phones have multiple microphones, often one near the speaker
        and one near the bottom of the device. These components can be
        removed or disabled, but doing so may affect the phone's functionality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dispose of the Phone Securely:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> After the phone has served its purpose, dispose
        of it in a way that ensures it cannot be traced back to you. This
        may involve physically destroying the device or disposing of it
        in a location far from where you live or work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
